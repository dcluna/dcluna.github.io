First engineer for their analytics suite (https://www.adquick.com/analytics), building products such as OOH attribution (https://blog.adquick.com/blog/ooh-attribution/).

Built the early prototype of what came to be [AdQuick's AI planner](https://blog.adquick.com/blog/democratizing-out-of-home-advertising-adquicks-ai-campaign-planner/) during a company hackathon.

## [Chime](https://www.chime.com/)

Built the backend for the first iteration of the company's [credit builder card](https://www.chime.com/credit/credit-builder/).

Led the development effort on the restyling of their [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.commcare.dalvik&hl=en). It's open source, so you can even see [my contributions](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-odk/commits?author=dcluna) to the project.

## [GuiaBolso](https://archive.ph/buTC9) #

Developed the (Grails + Postgres + Amazon SWF) backend of the "financial health index" feature of the #1 financial app in Brazil, classifying users based on their spending habits and giving tips on how they can do better. It's been featured in some [financial newspapers](https://exame.com/tecnologia/guiabolso-e-a-planilha-de-gastos-que-se-preenche-sozinha/) and [websites](https://fintech.com.br/blog/fintech/o-que-e-guiabolso/) (unfortunately, links are Portuguese-only).
