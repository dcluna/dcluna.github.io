Some of the projects I've been involved with:

# [CommCare](http://www.dimagi.com/products/) #

Led the development effort on the restyling of their Android app. It's open source, so you can download and compare the [old](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.commcare.dalvik&hl=en) and [new](http://jenkins.dimagi.com/view/CommCare%20Mobile/job/commcare-odk/) (alpha) versions, and even see [my contributions](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-odk/commits?author=dcluna) to the project.

# [GuiaBolso](https://www.guiabolso.com.br/) #

Developed the (Grails + Postgres + Amazon SWF) backend of the "financial health index" feature of the #1 financial app in Brazil, classifying users based on their spending habits and giving tips on how they can do better. It's been featured in some [financial newspapers](http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/suas-contas,brasileiro-se-endivida--investe-menos-e-financas-se-deterioram-no-semestre,1740983) and [websites](http://www.arenadopavini.com.br/artigos/educacao-financeira/saude-financeira-brasileiro-piora-9-1o-semestre) (unfortunately, links are Portuguese-only).

# [CPqD Alcance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.cpqd.alcance&hl=en) #

Developed the UI of their Android app and helped integrate it with the company's in-house text-to-speech engine.
